multitasking 
-----------------

1.)process based multitasking  :- excuting multiple program simultiniously independent to outher program .
---it is not used in real time programming ..it is for os level.


2.)thread based multitasking:-executing multiple task simultiniously where each task is seperate
   independent path of same program is colled thread based multitasking,each independent path is called thread.
 --it is used to increase the performance by reducing exuction time of the program.
 
 Thread :-flow of execution having seperate job.
 we can define it by ywo ways:-
 1.By extending thread class
 ------------------------------
 
 thread scheduler:- it varies from jvm to jvm and output may be differ.
 
--- in multithreding overloading is not valid

---cannot create/overrid start() by the programmer

Life cycle of the thread
________________________________

Test t  = new Test()----born state --->t.start()-----running -----dead state
  illegal Thread exception
  
 2.) deffinig a thread by runnable interface
  ----------------------------------------
  it is present in java.lang package and it contains only run()
  
  //****impementing ruunable interface is recomended 
  
  get name and set name of thread
